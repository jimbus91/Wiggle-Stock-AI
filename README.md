This script is using the YahooFinancials library to scrape historical stock price data for a specific stock, specified by the user. It then uses this data to train a linear regression model and make predictions on the stock's closing prices. The script first gets the current date and date 10 years ago. Then it uses the YahooFinancials library to get the historical price data for the specified stock, between the 10-year ago date and the current date. It then iterates through the prices of the stock, adding the high, low, open, and close prices to their respective lists. After that, it uses the LinearRegression class from the scikit-learn library to create a linear regression model and fit it to the data. The script then splits the data into training and validation sets and uses the model to predict the closing prices for the validation set. Finally, it prints both the original and predicted closing prices.
